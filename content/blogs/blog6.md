###Biography

My name is Yishi Zhang, am I am currently reading **Master in Financial Analysis** program at London Business School (LBS). Before coming to LBS, I graduated with **First Class Honours** from London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE). I majored at **Accounting and Finance**, which helped me build up fundamental skills to kick off my professional career, and minored at **Philosophy**, which crafted my perspective in understanding the know-how of the world in depth. At LSE, I was also a dedicated president of Chinese Students and Scholars Association and a student representative of the Department of Accounting, which together trained my leadership style and my ability to stand in other people's shoes. 

After discovering multiple fields, I find myself deeply fascinated by the very smart ideas in the financial industry, thus become determined to succeed as a finance professional. Born and raised in China, I am excited to see how this country is rapidly growing, and I would like to ride on its "steep learning curve". Last summer, I worked at **China International Capital Corporation** as a Investment Banking Summer Analyst and have participated intensely in a $6b Initial Public Offering deal. I was lucky enough to obtain a return offer, and I look forward to leveraging the knowledge and perspectives from LBS to boost my presence in the industry.
